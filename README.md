Breadth First N-Queens Solver
===============

This was coursework for my AI Methods module.

Breadth first search doesn't really make much sense for this application, given that a solution will never be reached until level N is reached, but this was the assignment.

Usage is really straight forward, and the script is well commented.
Verbose version also included (a full trace was needed for the hand-in).
